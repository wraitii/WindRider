# Events and Traits

This is basically the basis of the idea I want to develop to make this game a solo, fun game.
Think Crusader Kings in space.

Your character will gain traits, and others will perceive those or not.
Characters also should gain outfit/weapon mastery, ideally, which would be compensated potentially on larger ships by better outfits. So as the player character gains experience, they'll be able to make rather OP fighters compared to earlier on, which is kinda cool.
