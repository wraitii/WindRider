# Big ideas about the HUD

Writing down some of my current direction about the HUD

I feel like many space games underutilise the HUD. Some are pseudo-VR (Elite), some are detailled (X), some are clean (Escape Velocity and clones).
I think the HUD should behave like 'augmented reality', essentially drawing firing line of enemy ships targeting you, highlighting some items and not others. 'Grativar' radars can get quite confusing, so focusing on what's important is important.
