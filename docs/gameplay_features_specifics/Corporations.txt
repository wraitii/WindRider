Corporations.

Corporations are the entities that bring you the outfits and ships (and maybe missionsâ€¦ in the future).
Why use corporations when most other games of the same kind do not really care about this? Well there is a reason why some games have it in the description: it contributes to the lore.
There is, for me, another big advantage. Since I intend for this game to ultimately have auto-generated content, having stable corporations allows me to lose the player less than if did not. You see a new product by a corporation? Well it's going to look and feel quite familiar. And that's really the gist of it.

Plus corporations could be used for missions and stuff. It would add a lot to the lore.

In itself, they don't have to be big sprawling empires. Could have just one guy.
