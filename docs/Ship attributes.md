# Ship attributes
(and the rationales behind them)

### Hyperjump Fuel
Hyperjump Fuel was present in the original EV series. I debated adding them, but it has a purpose: forcing the player to land in places it otherwise wouldn't land on. Clever design might even make some planets "hubs" where you kind of _have_ to land to refuel in your journey somewhere else.
Note that in the original Nova, HJ fuel also doubled as Energy, which I've separated here.

### Energy
So why separate energy from hyperjump fuel? Well because it makes hyperjumping special, so you can actually design things around it since the player may not have a way to recover it - you do need a way to recover energy, because many more things use energy, such as weapons. It also puts a limit on your ship's capability to add stuff to it that's not mass, and so we can play around with mass a little more.

### No heat mechanics
Also something I've debated, Escape Velocity didn't have a heat mechanism but both NAEV and Endless Sky do.
Truthfully, I think energy is already a good enough limiter (not to mention we _can_ user hyperjump fuel as a secondary rare resource).
Really, heat problems in sci-fi is just too realistic and uncool.
