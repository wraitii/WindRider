Stranger in a Strange land

But you know the land

You've been cryofrozen eons ago

You woke up yesterday.
Still in the same space in the middle of nowhere. Your ship a rock apparent to others.

You know perfectly where you are and who you are, and in a sense you also don't at all.
The world has changed in a thousand years.
You left it because it was about to die. You can't help but wonder what is has become.
