# Karman-Line
I can only describe this as a tentative crossover between No Man's Sky and Escape Velocity Nova. Both are away over-ambitious goals, but the core idea of the game is good. Read about it in "docs" if you can sort through my French.

You may find super-detailed information about the end goal in docs/Ramblings about what this game should be.txt
It's a rather long but hopefully interesting read.

This is a super-pet project of mine. I've had this idea/hope for a different space game for ages now. 2 years ago,I had began a simple project to learn more about modern OpenGL, called Karman Line, where I tried implementing good atmosphere rendering. I've got a little bit of motivation right now so I'm pushing it further in the direction I'd like it to go, but there's a really long way to anything that remotely looks like a game.
Untested on anything but my personal Mac computer.
