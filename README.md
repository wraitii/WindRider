This is a FLOSS game inspired by Escape Velocity Nova.
It's going to be superficially similar to Naev, Endless Sky and obviously EV Nova.

I've taken inspiration from various older ideas, which you may find in docs.
In particular, `Ramblings about what this game should be.txt` is a long but interesting (imo) read.

Uses Godot Engine (dev branch) because I've decided that I wanted to actually try and make something playable this time. I've tried this as a pet project coding my own engine recently, but it's just too time-consuming :p
